                <h2>The father of the Constitution of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</b>, popularly known as<u> Babasaheb Ambedkar,</u> was a prominent Indian jurist, economist, politician, and social reformer who campaigned against social discrimination against Dalits, women, and laborers. <b>He was born on April 14, 1891, in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, India,</b> into a Dalit (formerly untouchable) family.

Ambedkar was a brilliant student and earned multiple degrees, including a doctorate in economics from Columbia University in the United States. He played a pivotal role in the drafting of the Indian Constitution and is often referred to as the "Father of the Indian Constitution." His vision for an egalitarian society is enshrined in the Constitution, which guarantees fundamental rights and equality before the law to all citizens.

Throughout his life, Ambedkar fought against caste-based discrimination and advocated for the rights of marginalized communities. He believed in social justice and worked towards the upliftment of Dalits, also known as Scheduled Castes. He embraced Buddhism towards the later part of his life, seeing it as a means of liberation from the caste system.

Ambedkar's contributions to Indian society are immense, and he continues to be a revered figure, particularly among Dalits and advocates for social justice. His legacy remains influential in Indian politics, academia, and social movements, inspiring generations to strive for equality and justice for all.
